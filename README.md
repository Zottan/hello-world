# hello-world
This is my first repository in which I learn using github.

My name is Zoltan. I always had a thing for programming, electronics, things like that, but I never learned about them. I work in a completely different field, but my interest stayed, so I now attend a CAD-CAM programming course and self-learning Arduino. I hope this site will help me in the learning process and finally I can give back to the community.
